.chapter1 ._global0(u2,1) Strange things happen in life, and in the scheme of things a Steinway appearing a hundred
feet above a street in the middle of the day didn't seem unusual at the time. \n

.chapter1 However, the second piano made him rethink his luck with the first piano. Maybe the first time was incredibly
unusual. With more thought, it didn't seem like such a thing was even possible. There were no tall buildings near the street
and planes and helicopters, as a rule, don't carry pianos. \n

.chapter1 ._global0(d1,3) On the other hand, now that it had happened twice in the same month, maybe it is actually a frequent
occurance. The thought made him confused. On the one hand, it seemed incredibly unlikely to happen even once,
but the undeniable fact was that it was actually a common occurence. \n

.chapter1 After some contemplation, he decided to forget about the issue until a third piano hit his bus. At such a point,
there would be more reason to think about it and he'd also be able to make a data-backed decision. \n
